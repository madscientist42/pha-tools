# PHA Tools

This is a small collection of simple, sharp, yet capable C++ class objects
that are more specifically tuned towards Embedded (Linux, *BSD, you know...)
uses like GPIO handler classes, full bidrectional pipe redirection exec
calls.  That sort of thing.  While designed for specific solutions at the
time they were cooked up by Earl Consulting Services, Rocking Penguin
Entertainment, or PHA Technologies, they're fairly capable and really
generic- by design.

Some of these originated out of rpe-tools, but they really belong in
a more embedded type library that can be used for embedded and more, but
are more device specific as opposed to some of the Generic solutions
that're in RPE Tools.
